# Android Head-Unit PIN codes
This list contains default PIN codes for car Android Head-Unit used by many Chinese manufacturers. I cannot guarantee that any of these codes will work for you, but there is a high chance.

Usually these codes are used to access advanced settings in the manufacturer's app or the [Android developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options). I highly recommend checking the [REFERENCES section](#references), as it contains more information.

### rolling codes for android developer options
If none of the above codes worked for you, you can try entering **7890+hour on the device's clock**.
So, for example, if your Head Unit (HU) displays `10:31`, you should try entering `789010`.  

If above method does not work either, you can **try entering today's date (but remember to set it correctly first)**, separated by dots, like this: `dd.mm.yyyy`.  
So if it is `2024-06-14` (ISO date), try entering `14.06.2024` as a password.  

## Wrap Up
If you still cannot access developer options, ensure that you have entered every password from this list correctly. If the issue persists, consider searching or asking for help on [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/). Maybe someone has already encountered this problem and found a solution, you never know. :)

And if you discover another PIN or rolling code that has worked for you, **PLEASE SHARE IT WITH OTHERS**:
- post on [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/)
- some blog post
- or [just an issue](https://github.com/Thestroyer/Android-HU-codes/issues) here on github would be appreciated.
