# Android Head-Unit PIN codes
This list contains default PIN codes for car Android Head-Unit used by many chineese manufacturers. I don't guarantee that any of theese codes will work for you, but there are high chances. 
Usually theese codes are used to advanced settings in manufacturer's app, or to [android developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options). I highly recommend seeing [REFERENCES](#references), as it contains more information.

### rolling codes for android developer options
If none of above codes worked for you, you can try entering **7890+hour on the device's clock**.
So for example if your HU displays `10:31`, you should try entering `789010`.  

If above does not work either, you can **try entering today's date (but remember to set it correctly first)**, separated by dots, like this: `dd.mm.yyyy`.  
So if it is `2024-06-14` (ISO date), try entering `14.06.2024` as a password.  

## Wrap Up
If you still cannot access developer options then you should make sure, you entered every password from this list correctly, and eventually search / ask on [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/). Maybe someone already encountered this problem and found a solution, you never know. :)  

And if you find some other PIN or rolling code that worked for you, **PLEASE SHARE IT WITH OTHERS** somehow:
- post on [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/)
- some blog post
- or [just an issue](https://github.com/Thestroyer/Android-HU-codes/issues) here on github would be appreciated.
